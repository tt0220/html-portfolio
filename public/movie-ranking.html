<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
    <p>It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. 
        What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, 
        but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and 
        can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.</p>
    
    <p>The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.</p>

    <p>I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. 
        If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.</p>

<h3>The Godfather</h3>
    <p>This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter.
         An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, 
         directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.</p>
        
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
    <p>This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a 
        long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, 
        but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best 
        superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!</p>
